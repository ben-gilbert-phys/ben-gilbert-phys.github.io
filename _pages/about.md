I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory](http://llnl.gov), 
where I have been since I received my PhD in Physics from Columbia University in May 2024. 
I study the building blocks of atomic nuclei, using high-energy collisions between heavy ions 
at the [Large Hadron Collider](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider) (LHC). 
I have been a member of the [ATLAS](http://atlas.cern/) collaboration at [CERN](http://cern.ch) 
since 2019, where I am convener of the sub-group on Ultra-Peripheral Collisions (UPCs) of heavy ions.

I am particularly interested in understanding how complex atomic nuclei are formed from their 
fundamental constituents, quarks and gluons. I study these topics in [relativistic heavy-ion 
collisions](http://home.cern/science/physics/heavy-ions-and-quark-gluon-plasma), where 
the nuclei of heavy atoms are injected into the LHC and accelerated to nearly the speed of light. 
We then smash pairs of these nuclei together inside the ATLAS detector, and the remnants of the collision 
explode outward. When they pass through our detector, it is then possible to construct an image of the 
shattered ions and their interactions. Through these experiments, my research seeks to map out the 
quarks and gluons inside each nucleus, discerning new information about the structure of all 
matter and the forces which bind it together. 

Breaking down the nucleus
======
At the core of every atom, the nucleus is an incredibly complex object, formed by shells of protons 
and neutrons. A simple picture of these protons or neutrons is that they are each composed of three 
quarks, but their true "partonic" structure is far more complicated. They are bound together by Quantum 
Chromodynamics (QCD) which is an analog of electromagnetism, except where the force-carrying particles (gluons), 
can also interact with themselves. This self-interaction and the incredibly large interaction strength of 
QCD mean that protons and neutrons are not simply three valence quarks with a few gluons holding them 
together. Instead, the gluons can split, forming pairs of virtual particles, or re-combine, merging 
multiple gluons into one. These repeated processes of splitting and re-combinations form the complex 
sea of quarks and gluons at the interior of every atomic nucleus. <img align="right" src='/images/proton_quark_gluon.webp' width="400px">

This picture of a sea of quarks and gluons (partons) inside each proton or neutron is further complicated when you 
start packing them on top of each other in a nucleus. It was first observed (very surprisingly!) by the EMC 
collaboration in 1983 that a proton bound inside of a nucleus contains different numbers of partons than 
a free proton. The so-called "EMC effect", along with "shadowing" and "anti-shadowing" of lower-momentum 
partons cause nuclei to look different than one would expect. The reasons for these differences are deeply connected 
to the nature of QCD itself, and the goal of my research is to image the partonic structure of nuclei in order 
to learn more about matter itself and the forces which bind it together.

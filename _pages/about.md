I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory](http://llnl.gov), 
where I have been since I received my PhD in Physics from Columbia University in May 2024. 
I study the building blocks of atomic nuclei, using high-energy collisions between heavy ions 
at the [Large Hadron Collider](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider) (LHC). 
I have been a member of the [ATLAS](http://atlas.cern/) collaboration at [CERN](http://cern.ch) 
since 2019, where I am convener of the sub-group on Ultra-Peripheral Collisions (UPCs) of heavy ions.

I am particularly interested in understanding how complex atomic nuclei are formed from their 
fundamental constituents, quarks and gluons. I study these topics in [relativistic heavy-ion 
collisions](http://home.cern/science/physics/heavy-ions-and-quark-gluon-plasma), where 
the nuclei of heavy atoms are injected into the LHC and accelerated to nearly the speed of light. 
We then smash pairs of these nuclei together inside the ATLAS detector, and the remnants of the collision 
explode outward. When they pass through our detector, it is then possible to construct an image of the 
shattered ions and their interactions. Through these experiments, my research seeks to map out the 
quarks and gluons inside each nucleus, discerning new information about the structure of all 
matter and the forces which bind it together.
